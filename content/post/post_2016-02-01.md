Whoever is interested in any aspects of Debian and Ubuntu development, is welcome to this workshop. During this workshop we will be learning to package software for Debian and Ubuntu Linux Distributions in hands on manner.

The idea is to meet each other, learn together, work together and generally have fun hacking with our favourite GNU/Linux distributions. This workshop is our first meeting and we will agree on the future meetings as well. There is also a Facebook group called [Debian/Ubuntu GNU/Linux Hacking Meetings in Ulm](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1551713658479995/ ) .

The workshop will start on Saturday 6th of February 2016 at 11 am in [Hackerspace Ulm (aka Freiraum).]({{< relref "contact.md" >}})
