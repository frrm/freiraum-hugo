Hallo HackerInnen!

Shell scripting produces both love and hate reactions. Whereas it is very old and ugly, and it does not scale well, it is also true that it is extremely handy for many tasks, so that it looks like it is here to stay.

In this presentation I will give some advice on writing maintainable and robust shell scripts that properly handle unexpected error conditions. It is mainly focused in bash, but most of it is applicable to dash and to other shell interpreters as well.

The presentation will by around one hour long plus the time for discussion.

It will take place in English. If I try to make it in German, it will last three hours :)

Wann: 2016-3-6 11h
Wo: Hackerspace Ulm
