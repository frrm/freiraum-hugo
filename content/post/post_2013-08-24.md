Every Thursday there is a Meeting day in the Hackerspace Ulm (also known as
the Freiraum). New people are always welcome to join us.

Last Thursday (22nd of August 2013) there were lots of things happening in the
Hackerspace. We build some ham radio (Funkamateur) antennas and then we
measured them using [Vector Network Analyzer
(VNA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_analyzer_%28electrical%29 "VNA" ).
The antennas were surprisingly good although we did them quickly using some
cheap basic material. The nature of laws don’t respect the price of building
materials ;)

We also found out that the VNA is a really good instrument for testing
different kind of antenna types that people themselves invent. Its really easy
and quick just to make an antenna and them measure it. Then you can make some
changes and measure again. This could be called evolutionary antenna building.

There were also other things happening. Some people presented their projects
ideas and other people were giving comments and new ideas to them. This way
the projects can get lots of input and some problems can be solved. It’s also
an opportunity to get other people interested of the project and get them on
board. To make something together makes it more fun.

Measuring a [discone antenna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discone_antenna
"Discone antenna" ) with vector network analyzer. Discone antennas are
wideband antennas (in this case about 80 – 500 MHz).
