Bug Squashing Party (BSP) is is a come-together for fixing bugs in Debian Linux Distribution (or in other Distributions like Ubuntu or Mint).

We will learn how to report the bugs in the most effective way, or , if possible, we will try to fix them and contribute with patches. Bring your ideas, bring some errors you have run into. Please, bring your own laptop.

There is some more information available in a Facebook group called [Debian/Ubuntu GNU/Linux Hacking Meetings in Ulm](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1551713658479995/). You can registrate to the event in [Meetup.](http://www.meetup.com/UlmHackers/events/228552266/)
