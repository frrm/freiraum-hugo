The Hackerspace Night on Thursday 9th of October starts around 8pm.

There is a meeting of the Stratospheric Balloon Project starting around 9 pm. The idea of the project is to send a balloon with some measuring instruments to the Stratosphere. The project has a [wiki page](http://frrm.de/wiki/index.php/Stratosph%C3%A4renballon).

Welcome to the Hackerspace Night!
