Es folgt der Call for Paper des 22C3. Ich hatte keine Lust zum Übersetzen. Der Vortrag ist aber auf deutsch.

### Title

Tracking goods and tracing people - localization in the pizza man's universe

### Subtitle

Technical methods and social components of localization services for items
and people

### Abstract

This speech shows an overview and details about different technologies for
tracking & tracing systems. It categorizes and displays, how such tracking
systems work today, and where they're already running. The security aspects
of different tracking systems are reconsidered in detail.

Seeing, what's goin'on, the social consequences are enlightened. Those
consequences are as well commercial issues like results in changing market
power, as consequences for "consumers", people who should know what is
done with there data, but usually don't.

Having those tracking systems in business, a second look goes to tracing
systems of the states, and what are the dangers of abusing them.

A discussion follows, what should be demanded from a society, which moves
straitforward closer and closer to Orwell's nightmare.

### Description

This speech shows an overview and details about different technologies for
tracking & tracing systems, systems to localize items or persons.

The tracking systems showed include tracking goods and containers in
warehouses, tracking goods containers and vehicles in the transportation
market, and tracking vehicles, items and people for security purposes
and law enforcement.

It categorizes and displays, how such tracking systems work today,
and where they're already running. The security aspects of different
tracking systems are reconsidered in detail.

This includes localization technologies like GPS, cell info, and
gatewaying as well as the communications aspect using wired and
wireless networks. Also the problem of identification is spoken to.

As a result, the big picture is showed, how items and people can be tracked
through the world.

Seeing, what's goin'on, the social consequences are enlightened. Those
consequences are as well commercial issues like results in changing market
power, as consequences for "consumers", people who should know what is
done with there data, but usually don't.

Having those tracking systems in business, a second look goes to tracing
systems of the states, and what are the dangers of abusing them.

Automated face recognition systems as well as vehicle tracking systems and
systems to trace the movement of prisoners or people, which are grounded,
are showed and their potentials and constraints are discusses.

The possibility for automated tracking with electronically communicating
passports and tracing possibilities by lawful interception of mobile
communications are spoken to.

A discussion follows, what should be demanded from a society, which moves
straitforward closer and closer to Orwell's nightmare.
